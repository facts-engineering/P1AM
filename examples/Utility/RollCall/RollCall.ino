/*
	Example: RollCall

	This example shows how to use the rollCall function to ensure that
	modules present in the base match a pre-defined list. P1.rollCall should
	be called immediately after P1.init for best results.

	This example works with all P1000 Series Modules
 

	This example will check to see if Slot 1 is a P1-08TRS and Slot 2 
	is a P1-08SIM. If either module is missing or incorrect the P1AM-100 will:
		1. Report the error to the serial monitor.
		2. Disable any further writes or reads to or from the module.
		3. Return a bitmapped representation of any module in error
		   i.e. an error in Slots 1 and 3 would return 0x5. No errors
		   found would return 0.

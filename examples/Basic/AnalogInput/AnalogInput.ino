/*
	Example: AnalogInput

	This example shows how to read from analog input modules. 
	Analog inputs typically read a voltage or current signal.
  Ranges can be between 0-10V, 4-20mA, etc.

	This example works with all P1000 Series:
	 - Analog input modules such as P1-04ADL-1, P1-04ADL-2,etc.
	 - Analog combo modules such as P1-4ADL2DAL-1, P1-4ADL2DAL-2 etc.  

	This example will use a P1-04ADL-2 module in slot 1. It has a 13-bit resolution and reads a signal between 0-10V.
  We will use the built-in DAC on pin A0 as our output signal. It is 10-bit and outputs a signal in the range of 0-3.3V
  This example starts at outputting 1V and increases it by 0.1V every second. Once it hits 3.3V it resets to 0 and starts again.

  NOTE: While the built-in DAC is used in this example, you can use any appropriate source as a signal. If using a current input module, 
  DO NOT USE the built-in DAC.

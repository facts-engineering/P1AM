/*
	Example: DiscreteInput

	This example shows how to read from discrete input modules. 
	Discrete intputs are any input that is only ON or OFF such as a proximity sensor.

	This example works with all P1000 Series:
	 - Discrete input modules such as P1-08SIM, P1-08ND3, P1-08NA, etc
	 - Discrete combo modules such as P1-15CDD1, P1-15CDD2, P1-16CDR, etc.  

	This example will use a discrete input in slot 1 and will print out the value of channel 2.
